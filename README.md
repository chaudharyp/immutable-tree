# tree-implementation

Gives a basic binary tree implementation with the following functionality:
* Inserting an integer into the tree
* Checking if a given integer is present in the tree
* Deleting an integer from the tree

This is a work in progress and more functionality will be added in the coming days:
* Tree will be made immutable
* Tree will be made thread-safe
