# tree-implementation

Immutable, thread-safe binary search tree implementation with the following functionalities:
* Inserting an integer into the tree
* Checking if a given integer is present in the tree
* Deleting an integer from the tree
* Finding the largest key in the tree

Unit tests have been written using unittest standard library.

What can be improved upon?
* The input can be taken interactively from command line instead of hardcoding it into a file.
* Code can be made cleaner. This is my first full-fledged Python project and I haven't been able to fully utilize Python's elegance. Coming from a C# background, a lot of code is written in that way. This will improve over time.
